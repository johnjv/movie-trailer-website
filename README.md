Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
Version 1.3
5/13/15

This is my source code for Project 1 in Udacity's Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. It contains server-side code that stores a list of some of my favorite animated movies. This data is served as a web page allowing users to learn about the movies and watch the trailers. 

To successfully run the application, please ensure you have Python installed. Then, run the entertainment_center.py script.
